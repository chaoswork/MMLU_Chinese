这个问题涉及以下信息。“每个州的社会都是一种祝福，但即使在最好的状况下，政府也只是必要的恶；在其最糟糕的状态下，它是不可忍受的；因为当我们遭受政府带来的同样的苦难或暴露于一个没有政府的国家中可能遇到的同样的苦难时，我们的灾难会因为我们提供了我们所遭受的手段而加剧。政府像衣服一样，是失去纯真的标志；国王宫殿建在天堂朦胧的遗址上。因为如果良心的冲动是清晰，统一和不可抗拒地被遵从的，那么人类就不需要其他的立法者；但是由于这种情况并非如此，他发现有必要放弃他的一部分财产，为保护其他部分提供手段；他被同样的谨慎所促使，在其他情况下他选择了两个恶中的较小者。因此，既然安全是政府的真正设计和目的，那么不可否认的是，无论其形式如何，只要它能够最有可能地确保我们以最小的费用和最大的利益获得安全，就优于其他一切。”——托马斯·潘恩，《常识》，1776.在革命后的反联邦主义者中，以上所述的“苦难”通常是哪些方面的批判？,对贝肯农变乱的有组织反应,联邦对谢伊起义的反应,联邦对威士忌起义的反应,对酋长反叛的联邦反应,B

"This question refers to the following information.
Our leaders talk about stopping aggression from the north, but this was a struggle among groups of Vietnamese until we intervened. We seem bent upon saving the Vietnamese from Ho Chi Minh even if we have to kill them and demolish their country to do it. As the native people survey bombed-out villages, women and children burned by napalm, rice crops destroyed and cities overrun with our military personnel, they are doubtless saying secretly of the Vietcong guerillas and of the American forces, ""A plague on both your houses."" … Stop the bombing, north and south, end search and destroy offensive sweeps, and confine our military action to holding operations on the ground. Bombing the north has failed to halt or seriously check the flow of troops to the south and may, in fact, have prompted a much greater war effort by Hanoi.

"This question refers to the following information.
I come not to urge personal claims, nor to seek individual benefits; I appear as the advocate of those who cannot plead their own cause; I come as the friend of those who are deserted, oppressed, and desolate. In the Providence of God, I am the voice of the maniac whose piercing cries from the dreary dungeons of your jails penetrate not your Halls of Legislation. I am the Hope of the poor crazed beings who pine in the cells, and stalls, and cages, and waste rooms of your poor-houses. I am the Revelation of hundreds of wailing, suffering creatures, hidden in your private dwellings, and in pens and cabins—shut out, cut off from all healing influences, from all mind-restoring cares.… Could their melancholy histories be spread before you as revealed to my grieved spirit during the last three months, how promptly, how earnestly would you search out the most approved means of relief; how trifling, how insignificant, by comparison, would appear the sacrifices you are asked to make; how would a few dimes and dollars, gathered from each citizen, diminish in value as a possession, compared with the certain benefits and vast good to be secured for the suffering insane...by the consecration and application of a sufficient fund to the construction of a suitable hospital.…
